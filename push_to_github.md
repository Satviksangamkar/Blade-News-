# Push to GitHub Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: `telegram-news-scraper`
5. Description: `High-performance intelligent news scraping system with MongoDB Atlas, Google Gemini AI, and advanced caching mechanisms`
6. Make it **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
7. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Add Remote and Push

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/telegram-news-scraper.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify

1. Go to your GitHub repository URL
2. You should see:
   - `NEWS.PY` - Main application file
   - `README.md` - Detailed documentation
   - `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
   - `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
